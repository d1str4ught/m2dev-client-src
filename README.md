# Installation/Configuration
This is the third part of the entire project and it's about the client binary, the executable of the game.

Below you will find a comprehensive guide on how to configure all the necessary components from scratch.

This guide is made using a **Windows** environment as the main environment and **cannot work in non-Windows operating systems!**

This guide also uses the latest versions for all software demonstrated as of its creation date at February 4, 2026.

### ⬇️ Obtaining the Client Source

To build the source for the first time, you first need to clone it. In your command prompt, `cd` into your desired location or create a new folder wherever you want and download the project using `Git`.

<details>
  <summary>
    Here's how
  </summary>

  <br>

  >
  > <br>
  >
  >
  > Open up your terminal inside or `cd` into your desired folder and type this command:
  >
  > ```
  > git clone https://github.com/d1str4ught/m2dev-client-src.git
  > ```
  >
  > <br>
  >
  > ### ✅ You have successfully obtained the Client Source project!

### 🛠️ Building the Source Code

Building the project is extremely simple, if all Visual Studio components are being installed correctly.

<details>
  <summary>
    Instructions
  </summary>

  <br>

  >
  > <br>
  >
  > Open up your terminal inside, or `cd` in your project's root working directory and initialize the build with this command:
  >
  > ```
  > cmake -S . -B build
  > ```
  >
  > A new `build` folder has been created in your project's root directory. This folder contains all the build files and configurations, along with the `sln` file to open the project in Visual Studio.
  >
  > ![](https://metin2.download/picture/icUIK7eITD7ng1jNmMtz3N1jhc6GjKS9/.png)
  >
  > ![](https://metin2.download/picture/jS099wxf40xlxdPXRy1ZR7YqO86h7N3w/.png)
  >
  > Double click on that file to launch Visual Studio and load the project.
  >
  > In the Solution Explorer, select all the projects minus the container folders, right click on one of the selected items, and click **Properties**
  >
  > ![](https://metin2.download/picture/J6aHw6uw330DeqyTaw2ZDVgRcT9hr3hr/.png)
  >
  > Next, make sure that the following settings are adjusted like this:
  >
  > 1. **Windows SDK Version** should be the latest of Windows 10. It is not recommended to select any Windows 11 versions yet if avalable.
  > 2. **Platform Toolset** is the most important part for your build to succeed! Select the highest number you see. **v145** is for Visual Studio 2026. If you are running Visual Studio 2022 you won't have that, you will have **v143**, select that one, same goes for older Visual Studio versions.
  > 3. **C++ Language Standard** should be C++20 as it is the new standard defined in the CMakeList.txt files as well. Might as well set it like that for all dependencies.
  > 4. **C Language Standard** should be C17 as it is the new standard defined in the CMakeList.txt files as well. Might as well set it like that for all dependencies.
  >
  > Once done, click Apply and then OK to close this dialog.
  >
  > ![](https://metin2.download/picture/2uacNZ4zOCYfI6vmigMTFwbuQ4tcmZ1C/.png)
  >
  > After that, in the toolbar at the top of the window, select your desired output configuration:
  >
  > ![](https://metin2.download/picture/cB0AGhHJ3TKFResDSeIgGmF7Vbo2SyGK/.png)
  >
  > Finally, click on the **Build** option at the top and select **Build Solution**, or simply press **CTRL+SHIFT+B** in your keyboard with all the projects selected.
  >
  > ![](https://metin2.download/picture/EN38Dz0Yef2edZ5Ptp4a5t4xWs1tr9V5/.png)
  >
  > **Note**: if this is **NOT** your first build after executing the `cmake -S . -B build` command for this workspace, it is recommended to click **Clean Solution** before **Build Solution**.
  >
  > <br>
  >
  > Where to find your compiled binaries:
  >
  > Inside the **build** folder in your cloned repository, you should have a **bin** folder and inside that, you should have a **Debug**, **Release**, **RelWithDebInfo** or **MinSizeRel** folder, depending on your build configuration selection.
  >
  > In that folder you should be seeing all your binaries:
  >
  > ![](https://metin2.download/picture/4cVxiU2Ac8CON58Gh70f6Do34dGBXpOz/.png)
  >
  > If you did **NOT** install the **Client** project yet, you are done here.
  >
  > If you **HAVE** the **Client** project installed, paste these 2 `.exe` files in these locations inside the Server project:
  >
  > - **Metin2_<Debug|Release|RelWithDebInfo|MinSizeRel>.exe**: inside root folder of the Client project
  > - **PackMaker.exe**: inside `assets\PackMaker.exe`
  >
  > <br>

  > ### ✅ You have successfully built the Client Source!
